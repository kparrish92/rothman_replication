- Had a major impact on the field of L3 acquisition.

- Has been supported in additional studies.

**Analysis**

Repeated the original analysis two-way ANOVAS for each task (percentage correct ~ group*condition)

Ran 4 total post-hoc Tests of Equivalence for each condition (pre vs post) and task (bounds d = +/- .4.)

# Smallest Effect Size of Interest

.large[
- TOSTS are a method that can marry our statistical tools and theory: researchers must specify equivalence bounds 
]

--

.large[
- The Smallest Effect Size of Interest (SESOI) is a good candidate for the equivalence bounds.
]

--

.large[
- The SESOI can be determined by:
  - Anchor based methods (Anvari & Lakens, 2023)
  - Differences in subjective experience (Anvari & Lakens, 2023)
  - benchmarks (Cohen, 1988; Plonsky & Oswald, 2014)
]

--

.large[
- Determining the SESOI is useful for both studies interested in statistical equivalence or difference, since it informs how many participants are needed.
